            Step 1: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and
            return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the
            bite, 3 to 5 minutes.

            Step 2: Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay
            wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce, mint,
            cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, then
            tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

            Step 3: For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl
            until well combined. Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.
