    <h2>Original recipe from chef Cheese Minh</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Beef Soup Bones: Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rice Noodles: You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the
            international aisle or another pantry aisle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beef: This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fish Sauce: Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion: Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spices and Seasonings: This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnishes: Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or
            anything else you like.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 4: Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft,
            about 45 minutes.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 5: Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce,
            and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into
            a saucepan and set aside.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 6: Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 7: When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 8: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.

        <br>

            Step 9: Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth
            over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Step 10: Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.
